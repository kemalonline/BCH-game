RANDOMIZATION
Round results are calculated based on 2 variables: a server seed and a BCH block hash (let's call it the client seed).

Before the game went live we generated a chain of 10,000,000 values. Each value being the hash of the previous chain value.

We announced the initial BCH block (client seed) and the last hashed value of the chain during the seeding event.

The BCH block was not mined when our seeding event was posted (its hash was unknown at the time). It means that we were not able to generate a chain that would produce results in our favour.
